<!--  Version 1.0-0

      This version of the slides is taken directly from Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel's lecture slides
      posted on OpenIntro.org in .pptx and .gdslides format. Simply moved to Rmd. 
      
      A large part of the HTML/CSS formatting is janky, and could be cleaned up. Feel free to issue a 
      pull request if you love HTML and CSS and want to fix this up.
