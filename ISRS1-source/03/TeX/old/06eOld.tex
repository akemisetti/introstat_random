{\eoce{A 90\% confidence interval for a population mean is (65,77). The population distribution is approximately normal and the population standard deviation is unknown. Given that this confidence interval is calculated based on an independent random sample of size 25, calculate the sample mean, the margin of error, and the sample standard deviation.
}
{
The sample mean is the midpoint of the confidence interval: $\bar{x} = \frac{65 + 77}{2} = 71$ \\
The margin of error is half the width of the confidence interval: $ME = \frac{77 - 65}{2} = 6$ \\
Using $df = 25 - 1 = 24$ and the confidence level of 90\% we can find the critical value from the t-table: $t^{\star}_{24} = 1.71$. Lastly, using the margin of error and the critical value we can solve for $s$:
\begin{align*}
ME &= t^{\star}_{24} \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \\
6 &= 1.71 \frac{s}{\sqrt{25}} \\
&= 0.342 s \\
s &= 17.54
\end{align*}
}
}

\eoce{For a given confidence level, $t^{\star}_{df}$ is larger than $z^{\star}$. Explain how $t^{*}_{df}$ being slightly larger than $z^{*}$ affects the width of the confidence interval.}
{
With a larger critical value, the confidence interval ends up being wider. This makes intuitive sense as when we have a small sample size and the population standard deviation is unknown, we should have a wider interval than if we knew the population standard deviation, or if we had a large enough sample size.

\eoce{
New York is known as ``the city that never sleeps". A random sample of 25 New Yorkers were asked how much sleep they get per night. A summary of some sample statistics is shown below. Do these data provide strong evidence that New Yorkers on average sleep less than 8 hours a night?
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrrrrr}

n 	& $\bar{x}$	& s		& min 	& max \\

\item Find and interpret the p-value in context. Drawing a picture may be helpful.
\item What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?
\item If you were to construct a confidence interval that corresponded to this hypothesis test, would you expect 8 hours to be in the interval?
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}

\item $H_0: \mu = 8$ (New Yorkers on average sleep 8 hrs per night.) \\
$H_A: \mu < 8$ (New Yorkers on average sleep less than 8 hrs per night.)

\item Before calculating the test statistic we should check that the assumptions and conditions are satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that the sample is random.
\item 10\% Condition: 25 $<$ 10\% of all New Yorkers.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that the number of hours one New Yorker in the sample sleeps is independent of another.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: We do not have a plot of the data however we can tell that there are no extreme outliers as all observations are within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
\[ 7.73 \pm 2 * 0.77 = (6.18, 9.26) \]
If there is skew, it is not strong. There are no red flags for the normal model based on this (limited) information, and we do not have reason to believe the number of hours New Yorkers sleep per day is not nearly normal. 
\end{enumerate}

The test statistic can be calculated as follows.
\begin{align*}
T &= \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{7.73 - 8}{\frac{0.77}{\sqrt{25}}} = -1.75\\
df &= 25 - 1 = 24
\end{align*}

\item $0.025 < p-value < 0.05$

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}
If in fact the true population mean of the amount New Yorkers sleep per night was 8 hours, the probability of getting a random sample of 25 New Yorkers where the average amount of sleep is 7.73 hrs per night or less is between 0.025 and 0.05.

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=55mm]{06/figures/eoce/newYork.pdf}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}


\item Since p-value $< \alpha$ (use $\alpha = 0.05$ since not given) we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide strong evidence that New Yorkers on average sleep less than 8 hours per night.

\item No, the hypothesis test suggests that the average amount of sleep New Yorkers get is significantly lower than 8 hours per night, therefore we wouldn't expect 8 hours to be in the interval.

\eoce{A college newspaper article claims that students at this college spend more than an hour per day on average on social networking sites. The article is based on a survey conducted at this college on a random sample of 45 college students who use social networking sites, which yielded a sample mean of 68.2 minutes with a standard deviation of 21 minutes. A histogram of the data is shown below.

{\eoce{Chain restaurants in California are required to display calorie counts of each menu item. Prior to October 2008 when a law went into effect that required calorie information on menus, the average calorie intake of a diner at a particular restaurant was 1900 calories. Suppose a nutritionist randomly samples 30 diners at this restaurant and finds an average calorie intake of 1806 calories with a standard deviation of 310 calories. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Do these data provide strong evidence that the average calorie intake has changed after calorie counts started to be displayed on the menus at this restaurant? You may assume that the distribution of the data is nearly normal.
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the average calorie intake of diners at this restaurant.
\item Does the conclusion of your hypothesis test agree with the confidence interval you calculated?
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The hypotheses are: $H_0: \mu = 1900, H_A: \mu \ne 1900$. \\
Before calculating the test statistic we should check that the assumptions and conditions are satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Randomization condition: Random sample of 30 diners
\item 10\% Condition: 30 $<$ 10\% of diners at a chain restaurant
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and 10\% condition is met, we can assume that the amount of calorie intake for one diner is independent of another.
\item Nearly normal condition: We do not have a graphical way of checking the distribution of calories in the sample, but the question states that we may assume the distribution is nearly normal.
\end{enumerate}
The test statistic and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
T_{df} &= \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{1900 - 1806}{\frac{319}{\sqrt{30}}} = -1.61 \\
df &= n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29 \\
0.10 &< p-value < 0.20
\end{align*}
Since p-value $>$ 0.05, we fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide strong evidence of a significant change in the average calorie intake of diners at this restaurant.
\item Given that $t_{29}^\star = 2.05$, a 95\% confidence interval can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
\bar{x} \pm t_{df}^\star \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} &= 1806 \pm 2.05 \frac{319}{\sqrt{30}} \\
&= 1806 \pm 119 \\
&= (1687, 1925)
\end{align*}
We are 95\% confident that diners at this restaurant consume an average of 1687 calories to 1925 calories per meal.
\item Yes, we failed to reject $H_0$ and concluded that a mean calorie intake of 1900 calories was plausible. This value is included in the confidence interval as well.

{\eoce{Fueleconomy.gov, the official U.S. government source for fuel economy information, allows users to share gas mileage information on their vehicles.

Before calculating the test statistic we should check that the assumptions and conditions are satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Randomization condition: We will assume that the sample is random though this assumption might not be plausible since drivers who volunteer to submit their gas mileage might be those that are getting much lower or much higher than the gas mileage claimed by the EPA.
\item 10\% Condition: 25 $<$ 10\% of all 2009 Prii.

\item Nearly normal condition: The sample distribution looks somewhat right skewed but the skew is not very strong.

Since p-value $<$ 0.01 we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence against the EPA claim of 46 MPG.
\item Given that $t_{24}^\star = 1.71$, a 90\% confidence interval can be calculated as follows:

\item Chicken that were fed linseed on average weigh 218.75 grams while those that were given horsebean weigh on average 160.20 grams. Both distributions are relatively symmetric with no apparent outliers. There is a lot more variability in the weights of chicken that were given linseed.

\item Let linseed be group 1 and horsebean be group 2. Then,\\
$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ \\
$H_0: \mu_1 \ne \mu_2$ \\

Before calculating the test statistic we should check that the assumptions and conditions are satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that chickens are randomly assigned to feed groups.
\item 10\% Condition: 12 and 10 $<$ 10\% of all chickens fed linseed and horsebean.
\end{itemize}
Since we have random samples and the 10\% condition is satisfied for both samples, we can assume that the weights of chicken fed linseed are independent of each other, as well as the weights of chicken fed horsebean.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: We can see from the box plots that the distributions of weights of chicken in the two samples are pretty symmetric.
\item Independent Groups: Since assignment is done randomly the two samples are independent of each other.
\end{enumerate}

Since population standard deviations are unknown and samples are small we calculate a t score.

\[ T = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} }} = \frac{(218.75 - 160.20) - 0}{ \sqrt{\frac{52.24^2}{12} + \frac{38.63^2}{10}} } = 3.02 \]
\[ df = min(n_1 - 1, n_2 - 1) = min(11,9) = 9 \]
\[ p-value = P(|t| > 3.02) \rightarrow 0.01 < p-value < 0.02 \]

Since p-value $<$ 0.05, we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that there is a significant difference between the average weights of chicken that were fed linseed and horsebean.

\item Type I, since we rejected $H_0$.

$H_A: p > 0.31$
\item The success-failure condition is not satisfied. Under the null hypothesis, we would expect to have 25*0.31 = 7.75 
live births, not the 10 required for the normal approximation.
\item Each patient can be represented with a card. Take 100 cards, 31 black cards representing successful ART cycles and 69 red cards representing unsuccessful ART cycles. Shuffle the cards and draw with replacement 25 cards representing these patients. Calculate the proportion of black cards in this sample, $\hat{p}_{sim}$, i.e. the proportion of successful ART cycles. Repeat 10,000 times and plot the resulting sample proportions. The p-value will be the proportion of simulations where $\hat{p}_{sim} \ge 0.40$.
\item The p-value is represented by the area shown below in blue. In 2,285out of the 10,000 $\hat{p}_{sim} > 0.40$, therefore p-value $= \frac{1158}{10000} = 0.2285$. (Note that students may have approximate results.) 
\noindent \begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}
Since p-value is high, we fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide strong evidence that the the success rate for ART at this clinic is significantly higher than the average success rate.

\eoce{A ``social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same restaurant the same couple was depicted, however in one scenario the woman was dressed ``provocatively" and in the other scenario the woman was dressed ``conservatively". The table below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and whether or not they intervened.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll cc c} 
			&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Scenario}} \\
\cline{3-4}
							&			& Provocative	& Conservative 	& Total	\\
\cline{2-5}
\multirow{2}{*}{\textit{Intervene}}	&Yes 		& 5	 	& 15		& 20 	\\
							&No			& 15	 	& 10 	 	& 25 \\
\cline{2-5}
							&Total		& 20		& 25		& 45 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A simulation was conducted to test if people react differently under the two scenarios. In order to conduct the simulation, a researcher wrote yes on 20 index cards and no on 25 index cards to indicate whether or not a diner (represented by each card) intervened. Then he shuffled the cards and dealt them into two groups of size 20 and 25, the provocative and conservative scenarios, respectively. He counted how many diners in each scenario intervened, calculated the difference between the simulated proportions of intervention as $\hat{p}_{pr,sim} - \hat{p}_{con,sim}$. This simulation was repeated 10,000 times using software to obtain 10,000 differences that are due to chance alone. The histogram below shows the distribution of the simulated differences.

{\eoce{An experiment conducted by the \textit{MythBusters}, a science entertainment TV program on the Discovery Channel, tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns. 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a group where there wasn't a yawn seed (control). The following table shows the results of this experiment. \citep{data:yawn}

\cline{2-5}
							&Total		& 34		& 16		& 50 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
A simulation was conducted to test if people are more likely to yawn if a person near them yawns. In order to conduct the simulation, a researcher wrote yawn on 14 index cards and not yawn on 36 index cards to indicate whether or not a person yawned. Then he shuffled the cards and dealt them into two groups of size 34 and 16, for treatment and control, respectively. He counted how many participants in each group yawned in an apparent response to a nearby yawning person, calculated the difference between the simulated proportions of yawning as $\hat{p}_{trtmt,sim} - \hat{p}_{ctrl,sim}$. This simulation was repeated 10,000 times using software to obtain 10,000 differences that are due to chance alone. The histogram below shows the distribution of the simulated differences.
