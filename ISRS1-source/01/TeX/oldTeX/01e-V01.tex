{\eoce{A migraine is a common type of headache for which patients frequently use acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 100 adults suffering from migraine pain were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (50 in each). Patients in the treatment group received twice-weekly treatment for 12 weeks with an acupuncture program that was specifically designed to treat migraines. Patients in the control group received sham acupuncture (needle insertion at nonacupoint locations). Patients were asked at the end of the study whether or not they experienced improvement in migraine headache. The results are summarized in the contingency table below.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item What percent of patients in the control and treatment groups showed improvement?
\item At a first glance, does acupuncture appear to be effective treatment for migraines?
\item Does the data convince you that there is a real improvement for those patients in the treatment group? Or do you think that the results might just be due to chance?
\end{enumerate}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll  cc c} 
			&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Improvement}} \\
\cline{3-5}

\cline{2-5}
							&Total		& 37		& 63		& 100
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Percent who showed improvement in the treatment group: $35/50 = 0.70 \rightarrow 60\%$. \\
Percent who showed improvement in the control group: $28/50 = 0.56 \rightarrow 56\%$. \\
\item While 70\% of the patients in the treatment group showed improvement, only 56\% of the patients who got the sham treatment (control) showed improvement. There is a 14\% difference between the improvement rates in the two groups. It appears that patients in the treatment group are more likely to show improvement and hence at a first glance, acupuncture appears to be an effective treatment for migraine.
\item Even if acupuncture was not an effective treatment for migraine, typically we would not get the exact same improvement rate in each group. Maybe the difference of 14\% was just due to chance. However, our analysis does not indicate whether what we are seeing is real or a natural fluctuation.

{\eoce{A survey was conducted to study the smoking habits of UK residents \citep{data:smoking}. The table below shows how many of the males and females are smokers.

\item Does the data convince you that there is a real relationship between gender and smoking? Or do you think that the results might just be due to chance?
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Percentage of women who smoke: $\frac{234}{234+731} \approx 0.24 \rightarrow 24\%$ \\
Percentage of men who smoke: $\frac{234}{234+731} \approx 0.26 \rightarrow 26\%$
\item[(b)] 24\% of women and 26\% of men smoke. Even though these percentages are not equal, they are very close. So the 2\% difference might just be a natural fluctuation, which would mean that gender and smoking are independent. In Chapter 4 we will discuss further how close is close enough to say that independence is reasonable.
\item[(c)] The 2\% difference between the male and female smokers might also be an actual difference, which would mean that gender does have an effect on whether or not people choose to smoke. However, our analysis does not indicate whether what we are seeing is real or a natural fluctuation.

{\eoce{Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. Measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10$\mu$m (PM$_{10}$) at air-quality-monitoring stations were used to create exposure of estimates for periods of pregnancy. Birth weight data was also collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may contribute to the occurrence of preterm births. \citep{Ritz+Yu+Chapa+Fruin:2000}}

{\eoce{The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a study aimed to determine the effectiveness of this method, 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma were divided into two groups. One group practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant improvement in asthma with a reduction in symptom and medication and improvement in quality of life. \citep{McDowan:2003}}

{\eoce{Definition of obesity is based on body fat percentage (more than 35\% body fat for women and more than 25\% for men), however measuring body fat percentage accurately is difficult. Therefore body mass index (BMI),  ratio of height and weight squared,  is often used as an alternative indicator for obesity. A common criticism of BMI is that it assumes the same relative fatness regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity. In order to determine how useful BMI is for predicting body fatness across age, sex and ethnic groups, researchers studied 202 black and 504 white men and women who resided in or near New York City, were ages 20-94 years, and had BMIs of 18-35 kg/m$^2$. Participants reported their age, sex and ethnicity and were measured for weight, height, waist and hip circumference and length of tibia. Body density and volume were determined by submerging the participants in water, and total body water was determined using blood testing. These measurements were used for calculating body fat percentage and fat free body mass.  \citep{Gallagher:1996}

{\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] There is a positive and linear association between life span and gestation, meaning that mammals with longer gestation periods tend to live longer as well.
\item[(b)] The association would still be positive; if as length of gestation increases life span is expected to increase, then as life span increases, length of gestation is expected to increase as well.
\item[(c)] No, they are not independent since there is a clear association between the two variables.

Another feature that is visible from the histograms are peaks at 10 and 20 cigarettes. This may be because most people do not keep track of exactly how many cigarettes they smoke, but round their answers to half a pack (10 cigarettes) or a whole pack (20 cigarettes).

We already calculated that 40\% of the men with black hair have blue eyes. We can also look to see what percent of brown and red haired men have blue eyes. If these values are close to 40\% we conclude that the two variables are independent since they do not have any bearing on each other.
\begin{itemize}
\item Percentage of brown haired men who have blue eyes: $800 / 1200 \approx 0.67 \rightarrow 67\%$
\item Percentage of red haired men who have blue eyes: $50 / 70 \approx 0.71 \rightarrow 71\%$
\end{itemize}
While only 40\% of black haired men have blue eyes, the percentages of red and brown haired men with blue eyes are so much higher. It appears that hair color does have some bearing on eye color, therefore we conclude that hair color and eye color are not independent.

The shape of the distribution of survival times in both groups is right skewed with outliers on the right side. The median survival time for the control group is much lower than the median survival time for the treatment group, therefore patients who got a transplant typically lived longer. The maximum survival time for the treatment group is much higher (about 5 years) than the maximum survival time for the control group. Even though the maximum survival time for the control group is about 4 years, this observation is an outlier. Overall, very few patients without transplants made it beyond a year while nearly half of the transplant patients survived at least one year. It should also be noted that while the first and third quartiles of the treatment group is higher than those for the control group, the IQR for the treatment group is much bigger, indicating that there is more variability in survival times in the treatment group.

One of the questions asked is ``Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?". 85\% of the parents who returned the questionnaire responded ``No" to this question and hence the school officials decide that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school.
\item A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who recently gave birth asking them about whether or not they smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later, however only 567 of these women are reached at the same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women represent a simple random sample of all mothers.
\item A orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients who do not have any joint problems and find that 20 of them regularly go running. She concludes that running decreases the risk of joint problems.
\end{enumerate}

{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Non-responders may have a different response to this question. The parents who returned the surveys are probably those who do not have difficulty spending time with their kids after school. Parents who work might not have returned the surveys since they probably have a busier schedule. This is not a good representation of all parents.
\item It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. They are probably renters (as opposed to home owners) which means that they might be from a lower socio economic status and hence this sample may not be representative of all mothers.
\item There is no control group in this study. It may be that if we looked at 30 patients with joint problems 20 of them regularly go running as well. Also, there may be lurking variables. For example, it may be that these people who go running are generally healthier and/or do other exercises.

{\eoce{Exercise~\eoceref{HeartTr} introduces the Stanford Heart Transplant Study. Of the 34 patients in the control group 4 were alive at the end of the study and of the 69 patients in the treatment group 24 were alive. The contingency table below summarizes these results.

\item Using a randomization technique, a researcher investigated the relationship between outcome and treatment in this study. In order to simulate a chance model she wrote whether or not each patient survived on 3$\times$5 cards, shuffled all the cards together, then dealt them into two groups of size 69 and 34. She repeated this simulation 250 times (using the help of a statistical software) and each time recorded thenumber of patients who died in the treatment group. Below is a histogram of these counts.

\begin{enumerate}[i.]
\item $H_0$: Independence model. The variables group and outcome are independent. They have no relationship, and the difference in survival rates between the control and treatment groups was due to chance. In other words, heart transplant is not effective. \\
$H_A$: Alternate model. The variables group and outcome are not independent. The difference in survival rates between the control and treatment groups was not due to chance and the heart transplant is effective.
\item A fewer number of deaths than expected under the assumption of independence would provide support for the alternative hypothesis as this would suggest that the treatment group has a higher survival rate.
\item Under the independence model, only 2 out of 250 times (a probability of 0.008) did we get 45 or fewer deaths in the treatment group. Since this is such a low probability, we can reject the claim of independence in favor of the alternate model. There is convincing evidence to suggest that the transplant program is effective.

{\eoce{Avandia is a controversial diabetes medicine that has been linked to higher risk of heart attack \citep{Avandia:2010}. In order to test this claim a researcher surveyed 253 diabetic patients 96 of which were on Avandia. It was found that 25 patients taking Avandia and 27 patients on other treatments had a heart attack. These data are summarized in the contingency table below.

Determine if each of the below statements is true or false. If false, explain why. Watch out: the reasoning may be wrong even if the statement's conclusion is correct. In such cases, the statement should be considered false.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Since more patients in the other treatment group had a heart attach (27 vs. 25) we can conclude that patients on other treatments are more likely to have a heart attack.
\item The data suggest that diabetic patients who take Avandia are more likely to have a heart attack since (25 / 96 = 0.26) 26\% of the patients in the Avandia group had a heart attack while only (27 / 157 = 0.17) 17\% of the patients in the other treatment group had a heart attack. 
\item The difference between the probabilities of having a heart attack in the Avandia and other treatment groups proves that Avandia causes heart attacks.
\item Based on this information we cannot tell if the difference between the probabilities of having a heart attack in the Avandia and other treatment groups is due to a relationship between the two variables or due to chance.
\end{enumerate}

{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item False. Instead of comparing counts, we should compare percentages of people in each group who suffered a heart attack.
\item True.
\item False. Association does not imply causation. We cannot infer a causal relationship based on an observational study.
