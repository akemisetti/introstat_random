\eoce{The scatterplots shown below each have a superimposed regression line. If we were to construct a residual plot (residuals versus $x$) for each, what would those plots look like?

\end{center}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The relationship is linear therefore the residuals plot will show randomly distributed residuals around 0 with constant variance.
\item The scatterplot shows a fan shape, with higher variability in $y$ for lower $x$. Therefore the residuals plot will also show a fan shape, wider around lower $x$, narrower around higher $x$.
\end{enumerate}
Note: Below are the residuals plots.

\eoce{Shown below are two plots of residuals remaining after fitting a linear model to the data. Describe any apparent trends in these plots and determine if a linear model would be appropriate for these data. Explain your reasoning.

\end{center}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item There is a fan shape in the residuals plot, therefore we would expect a fan shape in the scatterplot  of $y$ versus $x$ as well. Variability around the regression line will increase as $x$ increases. Since there is a trend in the residuals plot a linear model would using the methods we have described not be appropriate for these data.
\item There is an apparent curvature in the residuals plot meaning that the relationship between $x$ and $y$ variables is also curved. Therefore a linear model would not be appropriate for these data.

\eoce{The Great Britain Office of Population Census and Surveys once collected data on a random sample of 199 married couples in Britain, recording the age (in years) and heights (converted here to inches) of the husbands and wives \citep{Hand:1994}.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The association between husbands' and wives' ages is positive, weak, and linear. There are two potential outliers: a 33 year old man married to a 45 year old woman, and a 52 year old man married to a 32 year old woman. 
\item The association between husbands' and wives' ages is positive, strong, and linear. Since there is a lot of scatter potential outliers are harder to pinpoint. However 65 inch tall man married to a woman who is 69 inches appear to be an outlier.
\item The age plot shows a larger correlation. There is much less scatter in the age plot therefore the relationship is much stronger.
\item Unit conversions do not affect correlation since correlation coefficient is unitless. The correlation between heights in inches and heights in centimeters is the same.

\item There is no obvious explanation why simply being tall should lead a person to drive faster. However, one possible outside factor may be gender. Males tend to be taller than females on average, and and personal experiences (anecdotal) may suggest they drive faster (confirmed in sociological studies).
\item It appears that males are taller on average than females and they also drive faster. The gender variable is a lurking variable for the positive association we observe between fastest driving speed and height.

\item There is a very strong, positive association between diameter and volume. However it is difficult to tell if this relationship is linear or somewhat curved. We would need to see a residuals plot to determine the form of the relationship.
\item Since the relationship is stronger between volume and diameter, using diameter would be preferred. However, as mentioned in part (b), the relationship between volume and diameter may not be linear.

Even though the relationship appears linear in the scatterplot, the residuals plot actually shows a non-linear relationship. This is not a contradiction, residual plots can show any slight divergences from linearity that can be hidden in scatterplots. It is difficult to tell from the residuals plot if the residuals have a constant variance due to the curved shape. From the histogram we can see that the residuals are distributed approximately normally. However since the relationship is not linear, we do not need to check the other two conditions (nearly normal residuals and constant variability) as violation of one condition is sufficient to determine that we should not fit a least squares line to this data.

{\eoce{Exercise~\eoceref{coastStarlight} introduces data on the Coast Starlight Amtrak train that runs from Seattle to Los Angeles. The mean travel time from one stop to the next on the Coast Starlight is 129 mins, with a standard deviation of 113 minutes. The mean distance travelled from one stop to the next is 107 miles with a standard deviation of 99 miles. The correlation between travel time and distance is 0.636.

\item Amtrak is considering adding a stop to the Coast Starlight 500 miles away from Los Angeles. Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the travel time from Los Angeles to this point? 
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item First we calculate the slope.
\[ b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x} R = \frac{113}{99} * 0.636 = 0.726 \]
Then we make use of the fact that the regression line passes through the point $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$.
\begin{align*}
y - \bar{y} &= b_1 (x - \bar{x}) \\
y - 129 &= 0.726 * (x - 107) \\
\widehat{travel~time} &=  51 + 0.726 * distance
\end{align*}
\item $b_1$ = For each additional mile in distance, the model predicts an additional 0.726 minutes in travel time. \\
$b_0$ = When the distance travelled is 0 miles, the travel time is expected to be 51 minutes. It does not make sense to have a travel distance of 0 miles. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself.
\item In order to calculate the predicted time it takes to travel from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles we plug in 103 for distance in the model:

{\eoce{Exercise~\eoceref{bodyHgtShoGi} introduces data on shoulder girth and height of a group of individuals. The mean shoulder girth is 108.20 cm with a standard deviation of 10.37 cm.

\item A one year old has a shoulder girth of 56 cm. Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the height of this child?
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item First we calculate the slope.
\[ b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x} R = \frac{9.41}{10.37} * 0.666 = 0.604\]
Then we make use of the fact that the regression line passes through the point $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$.
\begin{align*}
y - \bar{y} &= b_1 (x - \bar{x}) \\
y - 171.14 &= 0.604 * (x - 108.20) \\
\widehat{height} &=  105.79 + 0.604 * shoulderGirth
\end{align*}
\item $b_1$ = For each centimeter increase in shoulder girth we would expect height to increase on average by 0.604 centimeters. \\
$b_0$ = People who have a shoulder girth of 0 cm are expected on average to be 105.79 cm tall. A person with a 0 cm shoulder girth does not make any sense. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself.
\item In order to calculate height from shoulder girth we plug in 100 for shoulder girth in the model:
\[ \widehat{height} =  105.79 + 0.604 * shoulderGirth = 105.79 + 0.604 * 100 \approx 166~cm \]
\item The residual can be calculated as follows:
\[ r_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = 160 - 166 = -6~cm \]
The residual is negative which means that the model overestimates this student's height.
\item No, we should not use this linear model to predict the height of this child since the data we used to create the model is for people with approximately 90 to 130 cm shoulder girth. The linear model may no longer hold outside the range of the data.

\eoce{How well does the number of beers a student drinks predict his or her blood alcohol content? Sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer. Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood \citep{Malkevitc+Lesser:2008}.  Note that in all states of the US the legal BAC limit is 0.08.  In this experiment, the students were equally divided between men and women and differed in weight and usual drinking habits. Because of this variation, many students don't believe that number of drinks predicts BAC well. In this problem, we examine how well the number of drinks predicts BAC when there are no other predictors available (each person’s tolerance is different, and you should not rely on these data to predict your BAC with high accuracy!). Given below is a scatterplot displaying the relationship between BAC and number of cans of beer as well as a summary output of the least squares fit for these data. \\

\item There is a fan shaped pattern apparent in this plot which indicates non-constant variability in the residuals (little variability when $x$ is small, more variability when $x$ is large). Since the residuals have changing variability as we move across the plot, we should seek more appropriate statistical methods if we want to fit a line to these data.

%\eoce{Is the gestational age (time between conception and birth) of a low birth-weight baby useful in predicting head circumference at birth? Twenty-five low birth-weight babies were studied at a Harvard teaching hospital; the investigators calculated the regression of the response variable, head circumference (measured in centimeters), against the predictor, gestational age (measured in weeks). The estimated regression was
%\[ \widehat{headCircumference} = 3.91 + 0.78 * gestationalAge \]
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item What is the predicted head circumference for a baby whose gestational age is 28 weeks?
%\item The standard error for the coefficient of gestational age is 0.35. Does the regression suggest that gestational age is significantly associated with head circumference? Conduct a two-sided hypothesis test at significance level 0.05 to support your answer. Show each step of the hypothesis test.

%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%\item The predicted head circumference for a baby whose gestational age is 28 weeks can be calculated as follows:
%\[ \widehat{head~circumference} = 3.91 + 0.78 * 28 = 25.75 \]
%\item $H_0$: The true coefficient for \texttt{gestationalAge} is zero ($\beta_1 = 0$). \\
%$H_0$: The true coefficient for \texttt{gestationalAge} is greater than zero ($\beta_1 \ne 0$). \\
%The test statistic can be calculated as:
%\[ t = \frac{estimate - null~value}{SE} = \frac{0.78 - 0}{0.35} = 2.23 \]
%with $df = n - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23$. Using the t-table, the two-tailed p-value is between 0.02 and 0.05, which is lower than the significance level of 0.05. With such a low p-value we reject $H_0$ and conclude that there is an association between gestational age and head circumference and that the true slope parameter is not 0.
