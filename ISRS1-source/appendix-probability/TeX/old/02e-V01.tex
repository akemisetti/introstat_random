\eoce{True or false: If a fair coin is tossed many times and the last eight tosses are all heads, then the chance that the next toss will be heads is somewhat less than 50\%.}
{False. Since these are independent trials the probability does not change from trial to trial and does not depend on what the outcome was on the previous trial(s). Therefore, in the next toss the probability of getting a head will still be 0.5.}


\eoce{Determine if the below statements are true of false and explain your reasoning.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Drawing a face card (jack, queen, or king) and drawing a red card from a full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.
\item Drawing a face card and drawing an ace from a full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item False. There are red face cards (jack, queen, or king of hearts and diamonds). Since a card can be both a face card and a red card, the two events are not mutually exclusive.
\item True. A card cannot be both a face card and an ace.
\end{enumerate}
}


\eoce{Below are four scenarios, each describing two games. In the first game, a coin is tossed 10 times. In the second game, a coin is tossed 100 times. For each scenario, if you could only play one game, which would you play? Explain your reasoning.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item If it is heads more than 60\% of the time, you win \$1.
\item If it is heads more than 40\% of the time, you win \$1.
\item If it is heads between 40\% and 60\% of the time, you win \$1.
\item If it is heads less than 30\% of the time, you win \$1.
\end{enumerate}
} 
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 10 tosses. Since the desired outcome is larger than the expected proportion of heads (50\%), we would want fewer trials (flips). With a low number of flips the variability in the number of heads observed is much larger. For example, we wouldn't be very surprised if 7 out of 10 flips were heads. On the other hand, with 100 flips, we would be surprised if 70 out of 100 flips were heads. With 100 flips it would be more likely to get 50\% heads and 50\% tails, which is not what we want.
\item 100 tosses. The expected proportion of 50\% is greater than 40\% and with more flips the observed proportion of heads would be closer to the expected value.
\item 100 tosses. The expected proportion of 50\% is between 40\% and 60\%. With more flips the observed proportion of heads would be closer to the expected value.
\item 10 tosses. The desired proportion of heads (less than 30\%) is below the expected proportion and with fewer flips it would be more likely to observe a proportion that is not close to the expected value.
\end{enumerate}
}

% Probabilities (dice) - Independence (2.1.5)

\eoce{Backgammon is a board game for two players in which the playing pieces are moved according to the roll of two dice. Players win by removing all of their pieces from the board therefore it is good to roll high numbers. You are playing backgammon with a friend and you roll two double sixes in a row while your friend rolled first double ones and then double threes. Double sixes means that in a single roll of two dice, each die comes up as a six. Double threes means each die comes up as a three, etc. Your friend claims that you are cheating because it is very unlikely to be able to roll two double sixes in a row. Using probabilities how could you argue that your rolls were just as likely as his?
% in the second sentence, it's not clear that moving pieces corresponds to removing them and then winning.  how about redoing the second sentence: "Players win by moving their pieces all of the way across the board, therefore..."
}
{
\begin{align*}
P(\text{your rolls}) &= P(\text{six and six on the first roll and six and six on the second roll}) \\ 
&= P(\text{six and six on the first roll}) * P(\text{six and six on the second roll}) \\
&= (1/6 * 1/6) * (1/6 * 1/6) = 0.00077 \\
P(\text{friend's rolls}) &= P(\text{one and one on the first roll and three and three on the second roll}) \\
&= P(\text{one and one on the first roll}) * P(\text{three and three on the second roll}) \\ 
&= (1/6 * 1/6) * (1/6 * 1/6) = 0.00077
\end{align*}
Both outcomes have equal probability, therefore it is just as likely to roll two double sixes in a row as rolling first double ones and then double threes.

\item getting a sum of 12?

}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item P(sum of 1) = 0. Since there are two dice being rolled, the minimum possible sum is 2.
\item P(sum of 5) = P(1,4) +  P(4,1) + P(2,3) + P(3,2) = $\left( \frac{1}{6} * \frac{1}{6} \right)$ * 4 = $\frac{4}{36}$ =  0.11.
\item P(sum of 12) = P(6,6) = $\left( \frac{1}{6} * \frac{1}{6} \right)$ = $\frac{1}{36}$.

{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Yes, it is possible that both you and a randomly selected student from your class gets an A in this course, therefore these two events are not mutually exclusive. They are probably independent though since how well you do in the course is not dependent on how well a randomly selected student does.
\item Yes, it is possible that both you and a friend you study with from your class gets an A in this course, therefore these two events are not mutually exclusive. They are also probably not independent: if you study together how well one of you do in the course might depend on the other.
\item No, in part (a) we described two events that can occur at the same time but are not dependent.

\eoce{In a multiple choice exam there are 5 questions and 4 choices for each question (a, b, c, d). Nancy has not studied for the exam at all, and decided to randomly guess the answers. What is the probability that:

\item She gets all questions right?
\item She gets at least one question right?

\item Since she is randomly guessing, probability of getting each question right is $p = 0.25$. Then, \\
P(\underline{Wrong} \underline{Wrong} \underline{Wrong} \underline{Wrong} \underline{Right}) = $0.75^4 * 0.25 = 0.07910156 \approx 0.0791$.

% Cameras - indepedence

\eoce{Based on the probabilities provided in Exercise~\eoceref{cameras}, are the variables owning a DSLR and owning a point-and-shoot camera independent?}
{
If P(DSLR $|$ point-and-shoot) = P(DSLR), then the variables owning a DSLR and point-and-shoot are independent. So let's check if that's the case. \\
\begin{align*}
P(DSLR | point\&shoot) &= \frac{P(DSLR~and~point\&shoot)}{P(point\&shoot)} \\
&= \frac{0.20}{0.90} \\
&= 0.22

Since 0.22 $\ne$ P(DSLR), the two variables are not independent.

\begin{align*}
P(Spanish | French) &= \frac{P(Spanish~and~ French)}{P(French)} \\
&= \frac{0.20}{0.45} \\
&= 0.44

Since 0.44 $\ne$ P(Spanish), the two variables are not independent.

\item Are type and drive train independent? Would you be comfortable generalizing your conclusion to all cars?
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item P(midsize) = (17 + 5) / 54 = 0.4074
\item P(front wheel drive) = (19 + 17 + 7) / 54 = 0.7963
\item P(front wheel drive and midsize) = 17 / 54 = 0.3148
\item P(front wheel drive $|$ midsize) = 17 / (17 + 5) = 0.7727
\item The marginal distribution of drive train is as follows: \\

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
Drive Train & Probability \\
\hline
4WD		& 2 / 54 = 0.0370 \\
front		& 43 / 54 = 0.7963 \\
rear		& 9 / 54 = 0.1667
\end{tabular}
\item[(f)] The conditional distribution of drive train is as follows: \\

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
\multicolumn{2}{c}{Type = midsize} \\
\hline
DT & Probability \\
\hline
4WD		& 0 \\
front		& 17 / 22 = 0.7727 \\
rear		& 5 / 22 = 0.2273
\end{tabular}

\item It appears that type and drive train are not independent since the conditional distribution of drive train is different for each type of car. For example, while only about 63\% of large cars have front wheel drive, a higher percentage of midsize cars (about 77\%) and an even higher percentage of small cars (about 90\%) have front wheel drive. However it should be noted that the sample size is quite small (only 54 cars) therefore we may not be comfortable generalizing our conclusions to all cars.

% Cats Body Weights Gender

\eoce{Exercise~\eoceref{catsBodyWeights} introduces a data set of of 144 cats' body weights and Exercise~\eoceref{catsBodyWeightsGender} shows the distribution of gender in this sample of 144 cats. If a randomly chosen cat weighs less than 2.5 \textit{kg}, is it more likely to be male or female?
}

In order to answer this question we need to compare P(female $|$ $<$ 2.5\textit{kg}) and P(male $|$ $<$ 2.5\textit{kg}).
\begin{align*}
P(female\text{ }| < 2.5 kg) &= P(female\text{ }and\text{ }< 2.5 kg)  / P(< 2.5 kg)  = 36 / (36 + 25) = 0.5902 \\
P(male\text{ }| < 2.5 kg) &= P(male\text{ }and\text{ }< 2.5 kg)  / P(< 2.5 kg)  = 25 / (36 + 25) = 0.4098

\eoce{In a classroom with 24 students, 7 students are wearing jeans, 4 students are wearing shorts, 8 students are wearing skirts, and the rest are wearing leggings. If we randomly select 3 students without replacement, what is the probability that one of the selected students is wearing leggings and the other two are wearing jeans?}
{
The number of students wearing leggings is $24 - (7+4+8) = 5$. When selecting 3 students, there are three scenarios under which we would get one student with leggings and two with jeans: \\
\begin{center}
Scenario 1 = P(L,J,J) = $\frac{5}{24} * \frac{7}{23} * \frac{6}{22} = 0.0173$ \\
Scenario 2 = P(J,L,J) = $\frac{7}{24} * \frac{5}{23} * \frac{6}{22} = 0.0173$ \\
Scenario 3 = P(J,J,L) = $\frac{7}{24} * \frac{6}{23} * \frac{5}{22} = 0.0173$ \\
\end{center}
These scenarios exhaust the ways where we can get one student with leggings and two students with jeans, and these scenarios are also disjoint. Therefore, to determine the probability that one of the selected students is wearing leggings and the other two are wearing jeans we simply add up the calculated probabilities:
\[ 0.0173 + 0.0173 + 0.0173 = 0.0519 \]
Note that each scenario has the same probability.

\item E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = 64 + 12 = 76 \\
V(X + Y) = V(X) + V(Y) = 3 + 1 = 4 \\
SD(X + Y) = $\sqrt{V(X + Y)} = \sqrt{4} = 2$
\item Initially we do not know exactly how much lemonade is in the pitcher. Then we pour out an unknown amount. We should now be even more unsure about the amount of lemonade that is left in the pitcher.

%The numbers are very different in the US: 42.7% of wines sold are under $5; 43.2% are between $5 and $10. Just 14.1% cost more than $10 -- nearly double the world average, but still less than 1 of every 7 bottles, whereas I'll wager about 6 out of 7 bottles mentioned in articles about wine cost over $10. (I'm guilty here too.)
