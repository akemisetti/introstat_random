\eoce{True or false: If a fair coin is tossed many times and the last eight tosses are all heads, then the chance that the next toss will be heads is somewhat less than 50\%.}
{False. Since these are independent trials the probability does not change from trial to trial and does not depend on what the outcome was on the previous trial(s). Therefore, in the next toss the probability of getting a head will still be 0.5.}

\eoce{Determine if the statements below are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Drawing a face card (jack, queen, or king) and drawing a red card from a full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.
\item Drawing a face card and drawing an ace from a full deck of playing cards are mutually exclusive events.
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item False. There are red face cards (jack, queen, or king of hearts and diamonds). Since a card can be both a face card and a red card, the two events are not mutually exclusive.
\item True. A card cannot be both a face card and an ace.
\end{enumerate}

{\eoce{Below are four versions of the same game. Your archnemisis gets to pick the version of the game, and then you get to choose how many times to flip a coin: 10 times or 100 times. Identify how many coin flips you should choose for each version of the game. Explain your reasoning.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item If the proportion of heads is larger than 0.60, you win \$1.
\item If the proportion of heads is larger than 0.40, you win \$1.
\item If the proportion of heads is between 0.40 and 0.60, you win \$1.
\item If the proportion of heads is smaller than 0.30, you win \$1.
\end{enumerate}
} 
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item 10 tosses. Since the desired outcome is larger than the expected proportion of heads (50\%), we would want fewer trials (flips). With a low number of flips the variability in the number of heads observed is much larger. For example, we wouldn't be very surprised if 7 out of 10 flips were heads. On the other hand, with 100 flips, we would be surprised if 70 out of 100 flips were heads. With 100 flips it would be more likely to get 50\% heads and 50\% tails, which is not what we want.
\item 100 tosses. The expected proportion of 50\% is greater than 40\% and with more flips the observed proportion of heads would be closer to the expected value.
\item 100 tosses. The expected proportion of 50\% is between 40\% and 60\%. With more flips the observed proportion of heads would be closer to the expected value.
\item 10 tosses. The desired proportion of heads (less than 30\%) is below the expected proportion and with fewer flips it would be more likely to observe a proportion that is not close to the expected value.

\eoce{Backgammon is a board game for two players in which the playing pieces are moved according to the roll of two dice. Players win by removing all of their pieces from the board, so it is usually good to roll high numbers. You are playing backgammon with a friend and you roll two sixes in your first roll and two sixes in your second roll. Your friend rolls two threes in his first roll and again in his second row. Your friend claims that you are cheating, because rolling double sixes twice in a row is very unlikely. Using probability, how could you argue that your rolls were just as likely as his?}
{
\begin{align*}
P(your~rolls) &= P(six~and~six~on~the~first~roll~and~six~and~six~on~the~second~roll) \\ 
&= P(six~and~six~on~the~first~roll) * P(six~and~six~on~the~second~roll) \\
&= (1/6 * 1/6) * (1/6 * 1/6) = 0.00077 \\
P(friend's~rolls) &= P(one~and~one~on~the~first~roll~and~three~and~three~on~the~second~roll) \\
&= P(one~and~one~on~the~first~roll) * P(three~and~three~on~the~second~roll) \\ 
&= (1/6 * 1/6) * (1/6 * 1/6) = 0.00077
\end{align*}
Both outcomes have equal probability, therefore it is just as likely to roll two double sixes in a row as rolling first double ones and then double threes.

{
If P(DSLR $|$ point-and-shoot) = P(DSLR), then the variables owning a DSLR and point-and-shoot are independent. So let's check if that's the case. \\
\begin{align*}
P(DSLR | point\&shoot) &= \frac{P(DSLR~and~point\&shoot)}{P(point\&shoot)} \\

\item P(front wheel drive $|$ midsize) = 17 / (17 + 5) = 0.7727

 is as follows: \\

\hline
4WD		& 2 / 54 = 0.0370 \\
front		& 43 / 54 = 0.7963 \\

For example, while only about 63\% of large cars have front wheel drive, a higher percentage of midsize cars (about 77\%) and an even higher percentage of small cars (about 90\%) have front wheel drive. However it should be noted that the sample size is quite small (only 54 cars) therefore we may not be comfortable generalizing our conclusions to all cars.

\eoce{In a classroom with 24 students, 7 students are wearing jeans, 4 are wearing shorts, 8 are wearing skirts, and the rest are wearing leggings. If we randomly select 3 students without replacement, what is the probability that one of the selected students is wearing leggings and the other two are wearing jeans? Note that these are mutually exclusive clothing options.}
{
The number of students wearing leggings is $24 - (7+4+8) = 5$. When selecting 3 students, there are three scenarios under which we would get one student with leggings and two with jeans: \\
\begin{center}
Scenario 1 = P(L,J,J) = $\frac{5}{24} * \frac{7}{23} * \frac{6}{22} = 0.0173$ \\
Scenario 2 = P(J,L,J) = $\frac{7}{24} * \frac{5}{23} * \frac{6}{22} = 0.0173$ \\
Scenario 3 = P(J,J,L) = $\frac{7}{24} * \frac{6}{23} * \frac{5}{22} = 0.0173$ \\
\end{center}
These scenarios exhaust the ways where we can get one student with leggings and two students with jeans, and these scenarios are also disjoint. Therefore, to determine the probability that one of the selected students is wearing leggings and the other two are wearing jeans we simply add up the calculated probabilities:
\[ 0.0173 + 0.0173 + 0.0173 = 0.0519 \]
Note that each scenario has the same probability.
