\subsection{Paired data}

{\dph{
\eoce{Is there strong evidence that the continental U.S. is warming? We might take a simple approach to this problem and compare how temperatures have changed from 1968 to 2008. The daily high temperature reading on January 1 was collected for 1968 and 2008 for 51 randomly selected locations in the continental US. Then the difference between the two readings (temperature in 2008 - temperature in 1968) was calculated for each of the 51 different locations. The average of these 51 values was 1.1 degrees with a standard deviation of 4.9 degrees. We are interested in finding out if these data provide convincing evidence of temperature warming in the continental US.

\item Are the two data sets of 51 observations dependent or independent of each other? Based on this, what type of analysis should be conducted to test if these data provide convincing evidence of temperature warming in the continental US.

\item Calculate the test statistic and find the p-value.
\item What do you conclude? Interpret your conclusion in context.
\item What type of error might we have committed? Explain in context what the error means.

\end{enumerate}

{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The observations in the two data sets are dependent since they are recorded at the same location; therefore, a hypothesis test for paired data should be used for this analysis.
\item 
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that locations are sampled randomly.
\item 10\% Condition: 51 $<$ 10\% of all locations in the continental US.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that the temperature in one location is independent of another.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: As long as the distributions of the daily high temperatures on January 1 on 1968 and 2008 are not extremely skewed, $n > 50$ should be large enough to assume that the both sample means are normally distributed.
\item Dependent Groups: The two samples are dependent on each other.
\end{enumerate}
\item $H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$ (There is no difference in average daily high temperature between January 1, 1968 and January 1, 2008) \\
$H_0: \mu_{diff} > 0$ (Average daily high temperature in January 1, 1968 was lower than average daily high temperature in January, 2008.)
\item The test statistic and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\[ Z = \frac{\bar{x}_{diff} - \mu_{diff}}{ \frac{s_{diff}}{\sqrt{n}} } = \frac{1.1 - 0}{\frac{4.9}{\sqrt{51}}} = \frac{1.1}{0.6861} = 1.60 \]
\[ p-value = P(Z > 1.60) = 1 - 0.9452 = 0.0548 \]
\item Since p-value $> \alpha$ (since not given use 0.05), fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide convincing evidence of temperature warming in the continental US. However it should be noted that the p-value is very close to 0.05.
\item Type II, since we failed to reject $H_0$. If we made such an error and concluded that there isn't convincing evidence for temperature warming in the continental US, but in reality average temperature on January 1, 2008 is significantly higher than average temperature on January 1, 1968.
\item Since we failed to reject $H_0$ which claimed the average difference is equal to 0, we would expect a confidence interval to include this value.

\eoce{In 1964 the Surgeon General released their first report linking smoking to various health issues, including cancer. Research done by Sterling Cooper, a prestigious ad agency in New York City, showed that before the report was released, in a random sample of 80 smokers, the average number of cigarettes smoked per day was 13.5 with a standard deviation of 3.2. A year after the report was released, in a random sample of 85 smokers, the average number of cigarettes smoked per day was 12.6 with a standard deviation of 2.9. Is there evidence to suggest that the average number of cigarettes smoked per day has decreased after the Surgeon General's report?

\eoce{An article published in the International Journal of Obesity \citep{Romero:2008} examined the accuracy of BMI in diagnosing obesity. Data from 13,601 subjects aged 20-79.9 from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were studied. Two of the variables of interest were body fat percentage (BF) and lean mass. Below is an excerpt of some of results of this study. Note that BMI, BF and lean mass are given as \textit{mean $\pm$ standard error}. Assume that all assumptions and conditions for inference are satisfied.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}
\hline
Gender	& n		& BF (\%)			& Lean mass (kg)	\\
\hline
Men		& 6580	& 23.9 $\pm$ 0.07	& 61.8 $\pm$ 0.12 \\
Women	& 7021	& 35.0 $\pm$ 0.09	& 44.0 $\pm$ 0.08 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item One definition of obesity in women is greater than 35\% body fat and in men greater than 25\%. The cutoff for women is higher since women store extra fat in their bodies to be used during childbearing. This implies that women on average should have a higher body fat percentage than men. Test this hypothesis using $\alpha = 0.01$.
\item Lean mass and fat mass are what makes up a person's total weight. In part (a) we showed that women on average have higher body fat percentage. The data also show that women have lower mean mass. Is the only reason for this higher body fat percentage, or can you think of other reasons why women on average have lower lean mass?
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Let $\mu_1$ denote population mean for men, and $\mu_2$ denote population mean for women.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ (There is no difference between the average BF\% of men and women.) \\
$H_A: \mu_1 < \mu_2$ (Average BF\% of women is higher than average BF\% for men.)

Before we can do the hypothesis test we must first calculate the standard deviations of the two samples. Remember, $SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$. \\

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{center}
Men: 
\begin{align*}
0.07 &= \frac{s}{\sqrt{6580}} \\
s &= 0.07 * \sqrt{6580} \\
&= 5.68
\end{align*}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{center}
Women: 
\begin{align*}
0.09 &= \frac{s}{\sqrt{7021}} \\
s &= 0.09 * \sqrt{7021} \\
&= 7.54
\end{align*}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

The test statistic and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\[ Z = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2}{n_2} }} = \frac{(23.9 - 35.0) - 0}{ \sqrt{\frac{5.68 ^2}{6580} + \frac{7.54 ^2}{7021}} } = -97.35 \]
\[ p-value = P(|z| > -97.35) \approx 0 \]

Since p-value $< \alpha$, reject $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that average body fat percentage for women is higher.

\item Women on average tend to weigh less than men. Therefore their lean mass is bound to be lower than that of men.

We do not use $n \ge 50$ as a condition to check for the normality of the distribution of $\hat{p}$.
\item TRUE. The success-failure condition is not satisfied
\[ n\hat{p} = 50 * 0.08 = 4~and~ n\hat{q} = 50 * 0.92 = 46, \]
therefore we know that the distribution of $\hat{p}$ is not nearly normal. In most samples we would expect $\hat{p}$ to be close to 0.08, the true population proportion. While $\hat{p}$ can be as high as 1 (though we would expect this to happen very rarely), it can only go as low as 0. Therefore the distribution would probably take on a right-skewed shape.

\eoce{A Washington Post article \citep{WashingtonPost} reports that ``a new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that support for a government-run health-care plan to compete with private insurers has rebounded from its summertime lows and wins clear majority support from the public." More specifically the article says ``seven in 10 Democrats back the plan, while almost nine in 10 Republicans oppose it. Independents divide 52 percent against, 42 percent in favor of the legislation." There were were 819 Democrats, 566 Republicans and 783 independents surveyed. \\

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that the sample is random.
\item 10\% Condition: 783 $<$ 10\% of all independents.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that whether or not one independent opposes the plan is independent of whether or not another one does.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: First we must check if the success failure condition is met.
\begin{align*}
np &\ge 10 \rightarrow  783 * 0.50 = 391.5 > 10 \checkmark \\
n(1 - p) &\ge 10 \rightarrow 783 * 0.50 = 391.5 > 10 \checkmark

Since the observations are independent and the success-failure condition is met, we can assume that $\hat{p}$ is nearly normal.
\end{enumerate}

\item The test statistic can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
\hat{p} &= 0.52 \\
Z &= \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0q_0}{n}}} = \frac{0.52 - 0.50}{\sqrt{\frac{0.50 * 0.50}{783}}} = 1.12

\item p-value = $P(z > 1.12) = 1 - 0.8686 = 0.1314$
If in fact 50\% of all independents oppose the public option plan, the probability of getting a sample of 783 independent where more than 52\% oppose the plan is 0.1314.

\item No, since p-value $> \alpha$ (use $\alpha = 0.05$ since not given) we fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide convincing evidence to suggest that more than half of all independents oppose the public option plan.

\item Yes, since we failed to reject $H_0$, which claims that the proportion of independents who oppose the public option plan equals 0.5, we would expect a confidence interval to include this value.

\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Let $p_1$ denote the proportion of Democrats who support the plan and $p_2$ denote the proportion of independents who support the plan.
\begin{align*}
H_0: p_1 = p_2 &\text{ (Proportions of Democrats and independents who support the plan are equal.)} \\
H_A: p _1 > p_2 &\text{ (Proportion of Democrats who support the plan is higher than the proportion } \\
&\text{ of independents who support the plan.)}
\end{align*}

\item The test statistics can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
&\hat{p}_1 = 0.70	&\hat{p}_2 = 0.42 \\
&n_1 = 819		&n_2 = 783
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
success_1 &= n_1 \hat{p}_1 = 819 * 0.70 = 573.3 \approx 573 \\
success_2 &= n_2 \hat{p}_2 = 783 * 0.42 = 328.86 \approx 329 \\
\hat{p} &= \frac{success_1 + success_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \frac{579 + 329}{819 + 783} = \frac{908}{1602} \approx 0.57 \\
Z &= \frac{(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}{n_2}}} = \frac{(0.70 - 0.42)}{\sqrt{\frac{0.57 * 0.43}{819} + \frac{0.57 * 0.43}{783}}} = 11.32
\end{align*}

\item p-value = $P(z > 11.32) \approx 0$. The probability of observing a $z$-statistic of 11.32 or higher given that the proportion of Democrats and independents who support the plan were equal is very low, almost 0.

\item Since p-value $<$ $\alpha$ (use $\alpha = 0.05$ since not given), we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide convincing evidence to suggest that the proportion of Democrats who support the plan is higher than the proportion of independents who support the plan.

\item Since we rejected the null hypothesis, we may have committed a Type I error.

\item No, rejecting the null hypothesis of $p_1 = p_2$ is equivalent to rejecting that $p_1 - p_2 = 0$. Therefore we would not expect a confidence interval for the difference between the two proportions to include 0. Since the alternative hypothesis that we are sticking with states that the proportion of Democrats who support the plan is higher than the proportion of independents who support the plan, we would expect the confidence interval for $(p_{D} - p_{I})$ to be positive.

\item A 90\% confidence interval can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm z^* \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_1 (1 - \hat{p})_1}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2 (1 - \hat{p}_2)}{n_2} } &= (0.70 - 0.42) \pm 1.645 \sqrt{ \frac{0.70 * 0.30}{819} + \frac{0.42 * 0.58}{783} } \\
&= 0.28 \pm 0.04 \\
&= (0.24, 0.32)
\end{align*}

\item We are 90\% confident that the proportion of Democrats who support the plan is between 24\% and 32\% higher than the proportion of Independents who do.

\item 90\% of random samples of equivalent sizes will yield confidence interval that include the true difference between the population proportions of Democrats and Independents who support the plan.

\item No, based on the data we would conclude that there is a higher proportion of Democrats who support the public option plan than independents however we just cannot conclude that being a Democrat causes someone to support the public option plan as we cannot imply causation based on an observational study.

H_A: p_1 \ne p_2

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that both samples are random.
\item 10\% Condition: 11,545 $<$ 10\% of all Californians and 4,691 $<$ 10\% of all Oregonians.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that how much one Californian sleeps is independent of how much another Californian sleeps and how much one Oregonian sleeps is independent of how much another Oregonian sleeps.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: First we must check if the success failure condition is met.

\end{align*}
\item Independent Groups: The Californians and the Oregonians are independent of each other.
\end{enumerate}

\item The test statistic can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
success_1 &= n_1 * p_1 = 11,545 * 0.08 = 923.6 \approx 924 \\
success_2 &= n_2 * p_2 = 4,691 * 0.088 = 412.8 \approx 413 \\
\hat{p}&= \frac{success_1 + success_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \frac{924 + 413}{11,545 + 4,691} = \frac{1,337}{16,236} \approx 0.082 \\
z &= \frac{(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) - (p_1 - p_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p}) }{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}{n_2}}} = \frac{(0.08 - 0.088) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{0.082 * 0.918}{11,545} + \frac{0.082 * 0.918}{4,691}}} = -1.68
\end{align*}

\item p-value = $2 * P(z < -1.68) = 2 * 0.0465 = 0.093$

The probability of getting a z-statistic of -1.68 or lower or 1.68 or higher given that the proportion of Californians and Oregonians who are sleep deprived are equal is 0.093. In other words, the probability of getting a difference of 0.8\% or higher between the sample proportions of California and Oregon residents who are sleep deprived if in fact the two population proportions are equal is 0.093.

\item Since p-value $>$ $\alpha$ (use $\alpha = 0.05$ since not given), we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that the rate of sleep deprivation is different for the two states.

\item No, this does not imply it; though there is support for that statement. We cannot infer causation based on an observational study.

\item Since we failed to reject the null hypothesis, we may have committed a Type II error.

\item Yes, since we failed to reject the null hypothesis, it is possible that the two population proportions are equal to each other and hence the difference between them could be 0.

\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that the sample is random.
\item 10\% Condition: We can safely assume that 49 $<$ 10\% of all women with cervical cancer and 317 $<$ 10\% of all women without cervical cancer.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and with the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that whether or not one subject develops cervical cancer is independent of another.
\item Large enough sample size: All expected counts are at least 10.
\item Age at $1^{st}$ pregnancy and whether or not a woman has cervical cancer are both categorical variables.
\end{enumerate}
Since all assumptions and conditions are met, we can continue with the hypothesis test. The chi-squared statistic, the degrees of freedom associated with it, and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
\chi^2 &= \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} =  \frac{(42 - 32.8)^2} {32.8} + \frac{(203 - 212.2)^2} {212.2} + \frac{(7 - 16.2)^2} {16.2} + \frac{(114 - 104.8)^2} {104.8} = 9.01 \\
df &= (R - 1) * (C - 1) = (2 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 1 \\
0.001 &< p-value < 0.005
\end{align*}
Since p-value $< \alpha$, we reject $H_0$.  There is convincing evidence to suggest that there is some difference in rate of cervical cancer based on age at $1^{st}$ pregnancy and that age at $1^{st}$ pregnancy is a risk factor for cervical cancer.

\eoce{Exercise~\eoceref{drillBabyDrill} gives the results of a survey on support for drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California based on whether or not the respondent graduated from college. Based on these data do support for off-shore drilling and having graduated from college appear to be independent? Answer using an appropriate chi-squared test. Do not forget to check that the assumptions and conditions for inference are satisfied.
}
{
To answer this question we need to do a chi-squared test for independence.
\begin{align*}
H_0: &\text{There is no difference in rate of support for drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast} \\
&\text{of California based on whether or not the respondent graduated from college.} \\
H_A: &\text{There is some difference in rate of support for drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast} \\
&\text{of California based on whether or not the respondent graduated from college.}
\end{align*}
Under $H_0$ the expected counts can be calculated as follows: \\
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
E_{row~1, col~1} &= \frac{438 * (154+132)}{827} = 151.5 \\
E_{row~1, col~2} &= \frac{389 * (154+132)}{827} = 134.5 \\
E_{row~2, col~1} &= \frac{438 * (180+126)}{827} = 162.1 \\
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
E_{row~2, col~2} &= \frac{389 * (180+126)}{827} = 143.9 \\
E_{row~3, col~1} &= \frac{438 * (104+131)}{827}  = 124.5 \\
E_{row~3, col~2} &= \frac{389 * (104+131)}{827}  = 110.5 \\
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
Now that we have the expected counts we can check if the assumptions and conditions for inference are satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are not that the sample is random.
\item 10\% Condition: We can safely assume that 438 $<$ 10\% of all Californians who are college graduates and 389 $<$ 10\% of all Californians who not are college graduates.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and with the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that whether or not one Californian in the sample supports, opposes or doesn't have an opinion on off-shore drilling is independent of another.
\item Large enough sample size: All expected counts are at least 10.
\item Response and being a college graduate are both categorical variables.
\end{enumerate}
Since all assumptions and conditions are met, we can continue with the hypothesis test. The chi-squared statistic, the degrees of freedom associated with it, and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} &=  \frac{(154 - 151.5)^2} {151.5} + \frac{(132 - 134.5)^2} {134.5} + \frac{(180 - 162.1)^2} {162.1} \\
&+ \frac{(126 - 143.9)^2} {143.9} + \frac{(104 - 124.5)^2} {124.5} + \frac{(131 - 110.5)^2} {110.5} = 11.47 \\
df &= (R - 1) * (C - 1) = (3 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 2 \\
0.001 &< p-value < 0.005
\end{align*}
Since p-value $< \alpha$, we reject $H_0$.  There is convincing evidence to suggest that there is some difference in rate of support for drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California based on whether or not the respondent graduated from college. Support for off-shore drilling and having graduated from college do not appear to be independent.

\subsection{When to retreat}

\eoce{The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan \citep{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}. Each patient entering the program was designated officially a heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Some patients got a transplant (treatment group) and some did not (control group). The table below displays how many patients survived and died in each group. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcc}
  \hline
 & control & treatment \\ 
  \hline
alive &   4 &  24 \\ 
  dead &  30 &  45 \\ 
   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Construct a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of patients who survived in the treatment and control groups. Do not forget to check that assumptions and conditions for inference are satisfied.
}
{
Before we can construct a confidence interval, we must first check that the assumptions and conditions are met.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are not told explicitly that the samples are random so we will need to assume that they are.
\item 10\% Condition: We can safely assume that 69 $<$ 10\% of all heart transplant candidates who do get a transplant and that 34 $<$ 10\% of all heart transplant candidates who do not get a transplant.
\end{itemize}
Assuming random samples and with the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that whether or not one patient in the treatment and control groups survives is independent of another patient in the same group.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: First we must check if the success failure condition is met.
\begin{align*}
n_1p_1 &\ge 10 \rightarrow 69 *  \frac{24}{69} = 24 > 10 \checkmark &\text{  and \hspace{2mm} } n_1(1 - p_1) &\ge 10 \rightarrow 69 *  \frac{45}{69} = 45 > 10 \checkmark \\
n_2p_2 &\ge 10 \rightarrow 34 * \frac{4}{34} = 4 \times &\text{  and \hspace{2mm} } n_2(1 - p_2) &\ge 10 \rightarrow 34 * \frac{30}{34} = 30 > 10 \checkmark \\
\end{align*}

Since the success-failure condition is not met, we cannot assume that $(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$ is nearly normal and therefore cannot construct a confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of patients who survived in the treatment and control groups using the methods we have learned in this chapter.
