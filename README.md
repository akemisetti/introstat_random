# introstat_random
Material for Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation (Diez, Barr and Cetinkaya-Rundel).

Contains adaptations of the PowerPoint / Google Slides presentations created by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and provided under CC-BY license at openintro.org. All figures created by Cetinkaya-Rundel have been imported as-is: a future project is to rebuild all figures to dynamically generate via R.
